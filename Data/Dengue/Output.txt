Key facts  
 Dengue is a viral infection caused by the 
dengue virus (DENV), transmitted to humans via 
the bite of infected Aedes species mosquitoes.  
 Dengue is found in tropical and sub -tropical 
regions throughout the world, mostly in urban and 
semi -urban areas.  
 Nearly 100–400 million dengue infections 
occur each year while over 20,000 dengue -related 
deaths occur annually.  
 A person may be infected with dengue up to 4 
times during their lifetime.  
 Many Dengue infections are asymptomatic or 
produce mild illness, while occasionally it may 
cause more severe disease or death.  
 Although there is no specific treatment for 
dengue, early detection and access to proper 
management may significantly lower the risk of 
death.  
Prevention and control of dengue mainly depend 
on mosquito control.  
INTRODUCTION  
Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of 
an infected Aedes type of mosquito primarily the Ae-
des aegypti mosquito. Once infectious, the  mosquito 
can transmit the virus for the rest of its life . Though 
this mosquito originated in Africa, it is now found 
in tropical , subtropical and temperate regions  through-
out the world. Although there are around 140 species 
of mosquitoes could be found in  Sri Lanka, only Ae-
des aegypti  and Aedes albopictus  mosquitoes trans-
mit the dengue virus to humans. There are four sero-
types of the virus which can cause dengue (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3 and DEN4). Discarded receptacles 
(plastic containers, tins, cans, coconut shells etc.), 
water storage containers, automobile tyres and ma-
chinery parts, building structures (roof gutters etc.), 
household /institutional appliances (refrigerator trays, 
flower vases, ornamental ponds ) are identified as 
major mosquito breeding sites. Female mosquitoes 
lay their eggs on the inner walls of containers with 
water.  The entire life cycle of the mosquito lasts 8 -10 
days at room temperature but may vary with environ-
mental conditions.  
Dengue is becoming a major health problem which is 
both global and local, mainly among urban and semi -
urban settings. It is now endemic in more than 100 
countries in the WHO Regions of Africa, the Ameri-
cas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South -East Asia and 
the Western Pacific. Around 70% of the global dis-
ease burden is represented by Asia. There are around 
3.9 billion of people are at risk of infection with den-
gue viruses worldwide. The global incidence of den-
gue infections per year may range between 100 mil-
lion and 200 million. Recent estimates identified with 
cartographic approaches revealed this number is 
closer to almost 400 million and over 20,000 dengue -
related deaths occur annually.  
Although clinical dengue -like illness has been report-
ed in Sri Lanka since the early 20th century 
(serologically confirmed in 1962), Dengue fever and 
Dengue Haemorrhagic fever became nationally notifi-
able diseases in Sri Lanka in 1996. Dengue shows a 
seasonal transmission in Sri Lanka with two peaks 
occurring with the monsoon rains in June to July and 
October to December respectively while the majority 
of cases occur during June to July.  
There was an island -wide epidemic of dengue with 51 
cases of DHF and 15 deaths during the period 1965 -
1968. Thereafter, from the early 1990s , progressive ly

WER SRI LANKA 2023    
large epidemics with more severe and fatal DHF were reported at reg-
ular intervals. There were two epidemics of dengue reported in 2002 
and 2004 with 8931 cases and 15463 cases respectively. In 2017, a 
total of 186 101 suspected dengue cases and 440 dengue -related 
deaths were reported to the Epidemiology Unit which is the highest 
number of suspected cases reported in a single calendar year in Sri 
Lanka since 1996.  
In 2019, the mid -year peak in reported cases was shifted to the latter 
half of the year and this trend continued into early 2020 with a total of 
11 607 cases reported in January 2020 which was higher than the 
reported cases for the same period during 2017. Thereafter the report-
ed number of dengue cases during April - June 2020 dropped below 
the past five -year national average. This could be due to population -
wide mobility restrictions imposed as a response to the COVID -19 
pandemic and people were encouraged to stay at home and work from 
home. The 2022 year has recorded the highest mid -year peak reported 
during the past five years while more than 54% of the reported cases 
are from five districts (Colombo, Gampaha, Kaluthara, Kandy and 
Galle) of the country with Colombo reporting the highest.  At present, 
almost all districts in the country are reporting cases.  
Symptoms  
Most people who get dengue won ’t have symptoms while symptomatic 
illness may vary from undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF), den-
gue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue with unspecified manifes-
tations. The Onset of sudden high fever, severe headache, pain behind 
the eyes, nausea and pain in muscles and joints are major symptoms 
of dengue fever while some may also have a rash and varying degrees 
of bleeding from various parts of the body including nose, mouth and 
skin etc. Most patients get better in 1–2 weeks while  some people 
develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital. Dengue Haemor-
rhagic Fever  could be seen only in a small proportion of those infected 
and is the most severe form with significant bleeding manifestations. 
Patients who are suffering from Severe vomiting, abdominal pain, in-
crease thrust, drowsiness and excessive sleepiness, abnormal bleed-
ing manifestations – eg: heavy menstrual bleeding or menstruation 
starting earlier than usual, and reduced urine output must seek medi-
cal advice even though they don ’t have a fever. It is essential to seek 
medical attention immediately if the person is suffering from cold clam-
my skin and extremities, restlessness and irritability, skin mottling, 
decreased/no urine output, or behaviour changes like confusion.  
Diagnosis and treatment  
Dengue often goes unrecognized or is misdiagnosed as other fever -
causing tropical diseases . Early identification and management of 
Dengue may minimize morbidity and mortality. When a patient present-
ed with a high fever with flushed face/extremities and a positive tourni-
quet test (even with a normal platelet count) with leukopenia (WBC 
<5000 /mm3) without a focus of infection, mostly suggestive that the 
patient is having Dengue illness.  Detection of NS1 antigen from blood 
is a laboratory diagnostic test for dengue during the early febrile phase 
but NS1 does not help in differentiating Dengue fever from Dengue 
Haemorrhagic Fever.  
Dengue patients may also present with atypical manifestations like 
respiratory symptoms like cough, rhinitis etc. and gastrointestinal 
symptoms like constipation, colicky abdominal pain, diarrhoea or vom-
iting without classical clinical presentation. Most cases of dengue fever can be treated at home with pain medicine while for people with severe 
dengue, hospitalization is often needed. There is no specific treatment 
for dengue. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) can be used to control pain 
while Nonnon -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and 
aspirin should be avoided as they may increase the risk of bleeding. 
There is a novel vaccine called Dengvaxia for people who have had 
dengue at least once in their lives and live in places where the disease 
is more common. Patients who are being managed at home must first 
contact doctors and should also ensure adequate oral fluid intake to 
maintain normal urine output.  
Prevention  
There are no vaccines or specific antiviral therapies currently existing 
to control the growing threat of dengue globally. Early case detection 
and appropriate clinical management can reduce mortality. Effective 
mosquito control is the mainstay of dengue prevention and control. 
Surveillance and improved reporting of dengue cases is also essential 
to prevent and control the disease as indicated in the objectives of the 
WHO Global Strategy for Dengue Prevention and Control, 2012 –2020. 
The mosquitoes that spread dengue are active during the 
day. Therefore, personal protective measures should be applied espe-
cially during the hours of highest mosquito activity (mid -morning and 
late afternoon). Lowering the risk of getting dengue by protecting your-
self from mosquito bites could be done by using protective clothes to 
cover the body, especially for children in the mornings and afternoons, 
using physical barriers such as screening doors and windows of prem-
ises using mosquito -proof meshes, using mosquito nets, ideally, nets 
sprayed with insect repellent, application of natural repellents such as 
citronella oil, lemon grass oil, neem oil and chemical repellents con-
taining DEET ( N, N-Diethyl -m-toluamide). Repellent use must be strict-
ly done in accordance with the instructions noticed on the product 
label.  
Dengue transmission is predominantly seen in urban and semi -urban 
areas usually as family or immediate neighbourhood groups of pa-
tients. Therefore, if a member of the family or anyone in the immediate 
neighbourhood is found with dengue, those patients and contacts must 
be protected from mosquito bites.  
Travellers, especially children, pregnant women, and people with im-
mune disorders or severe chronic illnesses, should contact their doctor 
to receive personalized recommendations on the use of repellents and 
protection before travelling. Similar protective measures could be ap-
plied to symptomatic patients in order to prevent the disease from 
being transmitted to non -infected mosquitoes. Mosquitoes lay eggs in 
stagnant water which can survive up to one year while eggs can with-
stand dry environmental conditions and thereafter hatch when water is 
available, and the environment is favourable. Therefore, it is very im-
portant to keep neighbourhoods clean and free of receptacles which 
attract mosquitoes.
